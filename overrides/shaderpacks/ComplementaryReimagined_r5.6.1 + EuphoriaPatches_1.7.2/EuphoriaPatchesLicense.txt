       You may include This Pack in a Modpack only if:
         a. The Modpack includes the required Patcher mod to generate this Pack.

            functionally similar to the Patcher Mod.
         b. All requirements in CLA §1.3 must be followed, including:

            - Inclusion of the unmodified latest version of this license

            must be at least a three-character difference between the name of
            the Modified Pack and This Pack. Adding/removing non-alphabetic
            characters does not count.
